            <h2>Key Upcoming Space Programs</h2>

            <div class="program">
                <h3>NASA's Artemis Program</h3>
                <img src="../images/artemis.png" alt="Artemis spacecraft">
                <p>The <strong>Artemis Program</strong> is NASA's mission to return humans to the Moon by 2025. It aims to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar surface, establish a sustainable presence on the Moon, and pave the way for future missions to Mars. The program also involves building the Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the Moon and serve as a base for lunar exploration.</p>
