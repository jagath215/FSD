            <h2>International Space Station (ISS) Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>International Space Station (ISS)</strong> is a monumental example of international collaboration, serving as a space station and research facility orbiting Earth.
            The ISS orbits at an altitude of around 400 kilometers (250 miles) and is supported by various space agencies, including NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, JAXA, and CSA.</p>

            <h2>Purpose and Research</h2>
            <p>The ISS is primarily used for scientific research, providing a unique microgravity environment for experiments in various fields such as:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biology</strong>: Understanding how organisms behave in space.</li>
                <li><strong>Physics</strong>: Investigating phenomena that are affected by gravity.</li>
                <li><strong>Medicine</strong>: Studying the effects of long-term space habitation on human health.</li>
                <li><strong>Materials Science</strong>: Developing materials that may have applications on Earth and in space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>International Collaboration</h2>
            <p>The ISS is a symbol of peaceful international cooperation in space exploration. 
            Since its inception in 1998, it has brought together space agencies from around the world. The day-to-day operations and maintenance of the ISS are managed collectively by NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and other participating agencies, showcasing how nations can work together toward common goals in space exploration.</p>

            <h2>Human Space Habitation</h2>
            <p>One of the primary objectives of the ISS is to study the effects of long-term space habitation on the human body.
            This research is critical as humanity plans for future deep space missions, including trips to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Experiments aboard the ISS have provided valuable insights into how prolonged exposure to microgravity affects muscle mass, bone density, and cardiovascular health.</p>

            <h2>Technological Innovation</h2>
            <p>Besides its scientific contributions, the ISS also serves as a platform for testing new space technologies.
            These innovations include advanced life support systems, communication systems, and tools that will be crucial for future missions deeper into space.</p>

            <h2>Legacy and Future</h2>
            <p>The ISS continues to operate and will remain a critical asset for space research and international cooperation for years to come. 
            Its legacy will be foundational for future space missions, as the knowledge and technology gained from the ISS will aid in humanityâ€™s long-term goals, such as lunar exploration and Mars colonization.</p>
